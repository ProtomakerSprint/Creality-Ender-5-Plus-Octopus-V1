# NOTE The Servo voltage is 4 to 6 Volts input. The Servo signal pin to Endstop Pin ( PG15 ).
# Then I wire the power to 5 Volts FAN7+ (fan voltage set to 5 volts
# using jumper 366). 3.3 Volts from Endstop sometimes seems to stick Servo in position, intermittently
#
# I find that adding a capicitor, ( 1000uF 50 Volt low ESR Electrolytic capacitor ) in parallel with the 5 Volt input to the Servo has helped prevent the Servo sticking in position, intermittently

# Servo to move 3D Printed arm that wipe ooze from the nozzle
#
# Electrical Spikes maybe an issue: Servomotor protection circuit test. A diode may fix this issue

# I placed a 1000uF 50 Volt low ESR Electrolytic capacitor across the 5 Volt supply supply to my servo and after about 12x 3D prints I've had no further issues of control board shutting down
